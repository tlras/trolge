# trolge
This is a program I made to troll someone I know, feel free to troll others too :D.
I am not responsible for the chaos you cause with this.

## How to run.
The ability to install and use the Rust compiler is probably a good enough
competence test to prevent less-informed users here from running it on their
family computer, so I won't provide binaries or instructions, just source.

## License.
This program is under the Unlicense with the exception of the files in `data/`.
The files in `data/` have been fetched from various sources and all credit for them goes to their respective owner(s).
